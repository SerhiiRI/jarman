# ORG

 Emacs ORG-mode is killer feature of Emacs, why only emacs? Org-mode is open standart, and any editor can realize those functionality, but only emacs was writen for writing books, publishes, news, different kinds of scientific text in real life. Btw, many of firms, universytets continue making their documentation in emacs. 
 Emacs is only one editor which support Org-mode, Lex, Bibitex, Latex, Markdown with engine converter. You cannot create books, notes in `Intelij`, `VS Code`, `Atom`, it's hard way. If you want to create book you use `Word`, but it suck, or `Latex` if you want you book look good, but it's hard. 
 Org-mode is solution and option what you never thinking about.
 Org-mode has
 - Spreadsheet system.
 - Agenda system.
 - Quick and awesome note.
 - Book and publish system.
 - Static page builder. 
 - TODO task manager

 This text i put into GitHub. Good luck. Emacs is All, Emacs is love.
